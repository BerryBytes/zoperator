## **Pull Request Review Cycle**

### **Triage Process**

Each PR undergoes triage to:

- Verify all prerequisites are met.
- Assess whether the use case aligns with project goals.
- Assign reviewers.

### **Review Stages**

1. **Design Review:**
   - Ensures no major conflicts with the codebase.
2. **Code Review:**
   - In-depth review and testing of code.
   - May require changes or clarifications.
   - Contributors are expected to be responsive to feedback.
3. **Merge:**
   - Once approved, the PR is merged automatically or manually.

> ⚠️ During code freezes, PRs may remain unmerged until the release is complete.

## **Testing & Merge Workflow**

- Managed by the bot **[Myrmica Lobicornis](https://github.com/traefik/lobicornis)**:
  - Verifies GitHub checks, reviews, and mergeability.
  - Handles branch rebasing/merging if needed.
  - Adds labels like `status/3-needs-merge` to trigger merges.

#### Common Merge Labels:

- `bot/no-merge`: Prevents automatic merging.
- `bot/light-review`: Reduces required LGTM reviews from 2 to 1.

For more details, see the [Lobicornis README](https://github.com/traefik/lobicornis).

## **Why Was My PR Closed?**

Your PR may be closed if:

1. **Design Conflicts:**
   The work needed to make it mergeable is too extensive.
   - **Solution:** Create an issue first and involve maintainers during the design phase.
2. **Out-of-Scope Enhancements:**
   The PR is for a feature that doesn't align with project goals.
   - **Solution:** Always create an issue before submitting a PR.
3. **Inactivity:**
   If no feedback is received from the contributor for over **90 days**.

## **Why Isn’t My PR Reviewed?**

### Review Prioritization:

1. **Top Priority:**
   - High community engagement and broad applicability.
   - Issues tagged with `contributor/wanted` or `bug/confirmed`.
2. **Secondary Priority:**
   - Smaller enhancements or less critical fixes.
3. **Deprioritized:**
   - Large PRs that are difficult to review.
   - PRs submitted without an associated issue.

> No reviews are conducted during the final weeks of a milestone to reduce churn.

---

## **Best Practices for PRs**

- **Create Issues First:**
  Discuss your proposal with the team before starting work.
- **Submit Small PRs:**
  Break large ideas into smaller, logical PRs.
- **Comment Everything:**
  Assume reviewers are unfamiliar with your perspective or approach.
- **Write Tests:**
  Include adequate tests or ask for help with them.

### Need Help?

- Re-request a review after addressing feedback.
- Politely comment on your PR to bring visibility during triage.

---

## **Handling Feedback**

- **Disagreements:**
  If you believe a requested change is unnecessary, explain your reasoning politely.
- **Overwhelming Comments:**
  Focus on feedback from the primary reviewer (assignee). If needed, ask to fork a new PR to clear outdated comments.
