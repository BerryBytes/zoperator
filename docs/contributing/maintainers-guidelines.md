# Maintainer's Guidelines

Welcome to the **ZOperator Community**!

We strongly promote a philosophy of **openness** and **sharing**, and firmly oppose elitist or closed approaches. Becoming part of the core team should be accessible to anyone motivated to join this journey!

## Becoming a Maintainer

Before becoming a maintainer, a contributor must meet the following key requirements:

### 1. **Account Security**

- Enable [Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) on your GitHub account for enhanced security.

### 2. **Community Conduct**

- Demonstrate **consistent**, **helpful**, **non-threatening**, and **friendly** behavior toward other community members.

### 3. **Guideline Agreement**

- Read and accept the maintainer's guidelines.

### Additional Criteria:

A contributor should also fulfill one or more of the following:

- Opened and successfully ran medium-to-large pull requests (PRs) within the last six months.
- Actively participated in multiple code reviews of other PRs, including those from maintainers and contributors.

## Promotion Process

1. **Proposal**: Any existing active maintainer can create an issue proposing a contributor for maintainer status.
2. **Voting**: Other maintainers vote on the issue. If a quorum is reached, the contributor is promoted to a maintainer.
3. **Quorum Expiry**: If the quorum is not reached within one month, the issue is closed.

## Maintainer's Responsibilities & Privileges

### Responsibilities:

- **Review Prioritization**:
  - Prioritize **PR reviews**, **design reviews**, and **issue triage** over other tasks.
  - Focus on enabling contributors to meet quality standards rather than rewriting contributions.
- **Community Support**:
  - Ensure that contributors and community members feel **heard**, **respected**, and **valued**.
  - Actively collaborate to keep the project **thriving** and **active**.

### Activities:

- **Triage Actions** on issues and PRs (e.g., labeling, marking messages, or closing duplicates) should always result from a **collective decision** to share knowledge and maintain quality standards among maintainers.

## Communicating as a Maintainer

### Team Communication

- All maintainers are added to the **[ZOperator Maintainers Discord](https://link-needed)** server for efficient and direct communication.
- Discuss topics like **issues**, **PRs**, and **enhancements** for **immediate feedback** and decision-making.

### Transparency

- Every discussion aims to remain open, transparent, and informative for all.

### Open Discussions

- **Maintain open and active conversations** to continuously improve ZOperator and foster a **collaborative environment**.

## Maintainers' Activity Review

To ensure the core team remains **efficient** and **dynamic**, maintainer activity is reviewed regularly. A maintainer is considered active if they meet two or more of the following benchmarks within the last **six months**:

- Participated in at least **two or three maintainer meetings**.
- Conducted **substantial reviews** of at least one or two PRs.
- Opened one or two **bug fixes** or **feature PRs** that were merged or on track for merging.
- Contributed significantly to the "**Help Wanted**" program by answering questions or identifying issues.
- Engaged substantially with the broader community.

Maintainers must also consistently exhibit **helpful**, **friendly**, and **respectful** behavior toward both the maintainer team and the wider community.
